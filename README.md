# Schedule Generator

Hello there! This is the standalone repository for the schedule generator from my [school-management-api](https://github.com/SowinskiBraeden/school-management-api) project.
The algorithms have been moved out of `tinker.py` into its own python  
script. Version 1 and 2 are removed. The script can be found in the `/scheduleGenerator` folder. The algorithm has come a long way.  
Using real 2018 course selection data from my school, enabling me to better test the script.

V3 has a entirely different approach from V1 and V2, that you can read about at the top of  
the function in [`generator.py`](/scheduleGenerator/generator.py). The function is broken up into 6 steps, each step is labeled within  
the function with a comment, giving a brief explination of what that step contributes to the  
algorithm.
