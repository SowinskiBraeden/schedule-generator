# Schedule Generator

Hello there! This is the standalone repository for the schedule generator from my [school-management-api](https://github.com/SowinskiBraeden/school-management-api) project.
The algorithms have been moved out of `tinker.py` into their own python  
script. Version 1 and 2 are remoed. This is in the `/scheduleGenerator` folder. The algorithm has come a long way.  
Using real 2018 course selection data from my school I am able to test the script to its full potential.

V3 has a entirely different approach from V1 and V2, that you can read about at the top of  
the function in `generator.py`. The function is broken up into 6 steps, each step is labeled within  
the function with a comment, giving a brief explination of what that step contributes to the  
algorithm.
